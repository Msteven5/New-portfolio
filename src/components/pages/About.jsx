            Michael,
            and I have been interested in the tech field for a while, with a specific interest in coding. I have had
            friends
            that introduced me to the concept, after having preconceptions for years that it was not something that I
            would
            be able to accomplish. After I was able to come up with a plan,after years in retail, to join a coding
            bootcamp,
            I made the leap to switch career paths to become a Web Developer. In this portfolio, you will see how much I
            have accomplished towards my task. This is where I will be keeping my completed projects done throughout the
            coding bootcamp that I am working through, as well as any fun projects I have done on my own or with
            friends.
